# Built With 🔦

* NodeJS
* Loopback 3
* Cloud Object Storage
* Archiver
* MultiParty

As well as other npm packages like: dotenv, cfenv, debug, ibm-cos-sdk, moment, chai, mocha, supertest, etc;

# Ideas of future 🙌

👌  **Nice To Have**  Expire created Zip files after a specific period of time.

 I think will fit the current implementation to use Cloud Functions, creating triggers that will execute an action/function so that after 30 days of archive creation date can detele the archive from the Cloud Object Storage. 

👌  Add more unit tests
